# 🚗 TrueCost — Car Affordability Reality Check

**TrueCost** is a high-performance financial intervention tool designed to help Malaysian car buyers look beyond the monthly installment. It calculates the **actual** monthly expense of vehicle ownership—including fuel, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation—while providing AI-driven advisory to ensure long-term financial health.

Developed for **BorNEO HackWknd**, TrueCost bridges the gap between "what you can borrow" and "what you can actually afford."

## 🎯 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

* **SDG 1 (No Poverty):** Prevents debt traps caused by unaffordable vehicle commitments.
* **SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth):** Encourages responsible financial behavior and long-term wealth building.
* **SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities):** Provides free access to professional-grade financial modeling tools for all income levels.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **The "True Cost" Engine:** Breaks down ownership into six critical pillars: Loan Installment, Fuel, Insurance, Road Tax, Maintenance, and Depreciation.
* **Smart Affordability Assessment:** Uses a proprietary risk algorithm (Low, Caution, High Risk) based on salary, dependents, and job stability.
* **Wealth Gap Analysis:** An interactive visualization showing the "Opportunity Cost"—the wealth a user could accumulate over 5–10 years by choosing a more economical car and investing the difference.
* **AI Financial Advisor:** An integrated chat interface powered by **Llama 3.3** (via Groq) that provides personalized vehicle recommendations and debt-to-income analysis.
* **Comprehensive Vehicle Database:** Includes a pre-loaded dataset of **919 Malaysian vehicles** with real-world pricing and specifications.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

TrueCost was engineered as a zero-latency, single-page application (SPA) with no external framework dependencies.

* **Frontend:** Pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
* **AI Inference:** Groq Cloud API using the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model.
* **Data Visualization:** Custom-built SVG charting engine for programmatic line and bar charts.
* **Typography:** Playfair Display (Serif) & IBM Plex Mono for a premium "Financial Journal" aesthetic.

## 📊 Methodology

### 1. The Affordability Formula

The system evaluates safety using several financial benchmarks:

* **The 20/3/8 Rule:** 20% downpayment, max 3-year loan, max 8% of salary.
* **DSR (Debt Service Ratio):** Analyzing how the new car affects the user's total debt-to-income ratio.

### 2. Wealth Gap Calculation

$$Total Savings = (Cost_A - Cost_B) \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}$$


*Where $r$ is the annual investment return (benchmarked at 6% for EPF/ASB).*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/truecost.git

```


2. **API Configuration:**
Open `index.html` and locate the `GROQ_API_KEY` constant. Replace it with your API key from the Groq Console.
```javascript
const GROQ_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here";

```


3. **Run:**
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🧠 AI Implementation

TrueCost integrates advanced AI to transform raw financial data into personalized coaching.

### **1. AI Runtime Engine (Groq API)**

The application utilizes the **Groq API** powered by the `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model. To ensure accuracy and eliminate "hallucinations," the system uses a **math-first architecture**:

* **Smart Recommendation:** Instead of searching the entire 919-car database via AI, the system uses a deterministic JavaScript filter to find cars within **1.5x of the user’s safe budget**. This filtered list is then passed to the AI to select the top 3 best lifestyle matches.
* **Context-Aware Advisory:** The AI receives the user's specific financial profile (salary, DTI, dependents) and generates a structured verdict, risk assessment, and safer alternatives.
* **Interactive Advisor:** A rolling **8-message context window** allows users to ask follow-up questions about their specific results in real-time.

### **2. AI-Assisted Development**

The team leveraged **Claude (Anthropic)** during the engineering phase for:

* **Formula Validation:** Perfecting the compound interest models for the Wealth Gap analysis.
* **SVG Engineering:** Developing the custom programmatic logic for dynamic chart rendering.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Designing system instructions that adapt the AI's tone based on the user's risk level (e.g., providing more cautious advice for high-risk profiles).
